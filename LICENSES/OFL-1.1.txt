SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
---------------------------------------------------

Preamble
-------
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font design
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The fonts,
including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, redistributed and/or
sold with any software provided that any reserved names are not used by
derivative works. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under
any other license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this license
does not apply to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

Definitions

copyright statement(s) as well as the actual font data. This may include
source code, build scripts and documentation.
